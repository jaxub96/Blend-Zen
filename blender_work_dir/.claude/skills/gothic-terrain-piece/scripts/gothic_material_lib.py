# Reference helper functions for building Gothic (ZenGin) style terrain pieces
# in Blender via the blender MCP `execute_blender_code` tool.
#
# This is NOT a Blender add-on. It is a snippet library: read the function you
# need, paste/adapt it into an execute_blender_code call (or exec() this file
# directly from disk, as the workflow below does). Keeping it as plain text
# avoids depending on an installed add-on that may not be enabled.
#
# --- MESH-BUILD PHILOSOPHY (read this before generating anything) ---------
# 1. Build with QUADS. The whole piece -- terrain, water, buildings, roads --
#    is ONE bmesh, ONE connected vertex grid. Triangulate only as the very
#    last step (`finalize_for_zengin`), right before export/inspection. Tris
#    mid-development are only acceptable on genuinely flat surfaces that have
#    no other clean quad topology (e.g. a gable roof's triangular end wall).
# 2. No poles. Don't fan geometry out from a single center vertex (that's
#    where "primarily quads" breaks down for no reason) -- build islands as
#    a rectangular vertex grid with a height field, not concentric rings
#    around a point.
# 3. Everything is welded. A building sitting on the terrain is not a
#    separate object joined on top -- its wall-base ring reuses the actual
#    terrain vertices at its footprint, so the mesh has zero seams there.
#    Same for water: it is the same grid, continued past the shoreline and
#    blended down to water level, not a floating plane. Materials can (and
#    should) differ face-to-face across a shared edge -- that's normal
#    per-loop UV/material data, it does not require duplicating vertices.
# 4. Triplanar UV by default, EXCEPT for directional textures (paths, stair
#    treads, plank runs, anything with visible grain/flow) which need an
#    explicit tangent direction -- see `set_directional_uv`. Never rely on
#    bpy.ops.uv.cube_project for those: it is an implicit rotate-per-face
#    operator, so texture heading is not decided by the resulting UV
#    field, and any face whose dominant normal axis flips relative to its
#    neighbor twists that face's texture 90 degrees.
